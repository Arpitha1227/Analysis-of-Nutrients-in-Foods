# Food-Nutrients
This marks my inaugural Python project, which involved utilizing a dataset on food nutrition to identify the most protein-rich foods and devise a system for classifying them.
I have used the basics of descriptive statistics and techniques like binning, sorting, creating a vector and a subset of the data set as part of this project.
